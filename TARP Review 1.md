### **Product Vision**

The vision of an online porter booking system is to streamline the process of hiring a
porter by providing a platform that allows users to easily find, book, and pay for the
services of porters. By implementing the latest technologies we will attract the 
customers in large scale by making it extremely user friendly and convinient.


### **Problem Discription**


1. **Unorganized:** 
Porters are unorganized and there are too many of them at the
same time which leads to most of them not getting a customer.

2. **Mid-Night:** 
Customers arriving in the middle of the night, especially the elderly,
cannot find porters to carry luggage.

3. **Exploitation:** 
Porters are often paid very low wages.

4. **Lack of job security:** 
Porters are typically not provided with any form of job
security.

5. **Lack of legal protections:** 
Porters are not always protected by labor laws and may
not have access to legal recourse if they are mistreated or not paid for their work.

6. **Weight Limit:** 
Porters end up carrying more weight which can harm their body.

7. **Lack of advanced technology:**
The latest and advanced features such as 
 --Real-time GPS tracking
 --Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
 --Augmented reality (AR) navigation
 --In-app messaging
 --Voice recognition
 --Integration with third-party services
 --Payment gateway integration
 --Multi-language support
 Many other features that we will be mentioning below are not being implemented by anyone.

### **Motivation for Topic Selection:**

The motivation for an online booking system for porters (also known as porters or baggage carriers) could be to make the process of arranging for a porter more convenient and efficient for both the customer and the porter. With an online system, customers can easily find and book a porter in advance, and porters can also easily manage and keep track of their bookings. Additionally, an online system can also
provide a platform for customers to rate and review porters based on their experiences,
which can help improve the quality of service provided.

Another motivation for an online booking system is to reduce the chances of overbooking or no-shows, which can be problems with traditional manual booking methods. An online system can automatically keep track of availability and bookings, which can help reduce these issues.

Lastly, an online booking system can also be a way to provide financial stability to porters, which may not have regular employment or income.
Overall, an online booking system for porters can provide a better and more efficient service for customers, while also helping to improve the livelihoods of porters.

DOI: https://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?pid=S1665-64232014000300010&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en 

Authors: LM Ascencio et al.

Abstract:

In this article we propose a collaborative logistics framework for a Port Logistics Chain (PLC) based on the principles of Supply Chain Management (SCM) that rely on stakeholders integration and collaboration, providing a reference model for the inland coordination of the PLC. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, analyzing several cases in which SCM practices have been implemented as well as studies related to port development, governance, coordination, and best practices associated. This background information was used to identify current gaps in logistics management practices and potential scopes of intervention within the PLC to suggest a redesign process and configure new structures under a collaborative scheme, following the guidelines of SCM.

3. **Title: Planning enterprise resources by use of a reengineering approach to build a global logistics management system**

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1108/02635570110410672 

Authors: Shi‐Ming Huang et al.

Abstract:

Theoretically and ideally, enterprise resource planning (ERP) seeks to streamline and integrate operation processes and information flow within a company. Practically, ERP system implementation involves a much broader scope and in‐depth consideration within an organization. Concurrently, in response to this need for resource optimization, the impact of globalization has caused the emergence of a new business operation format, global logistics management (GLM). This pertains to the overall management system of a corporation’s undertaking of worldwide market distribution, product design, customer satisfaction, production, procurement, logistics, suppliers and inventory. Suggests building an ERP as the backbone for implementation of a GLM system, while minimizing the impact of changes by use of information system reengineering technology (ISRT). Proposes a novel development framework that applies ISRT and ERP to developing a GLM system to economize on the system implementation cost and minimize the impact of changes within the corporation as a whole.


4. **Title: Research and design of logistics management system based on internet of things**

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/AIMSEC.2011.6011405 

Authors: Changhui Yu

Abstract:

Through the study of the Internet of Things technology, the idea combining EPC Internet of Things with WSN is proposed which demonstrates the integration feasibility of the RFID and WSN technology. In order to improve the efficiency of logistics enterprises all aspects in the transport process should be monitored which need to apply the Internet of Things technology into the logistics management system. The logistics information is obtained by radio frequency identification, sensors, etc., is transferred by network which combines the Internet, mobile communication network and other network information transmission, and is analyzed and processed through the logistics management system. In this way functions such as user management, vehicle management, site management, order management, distribution management and other functions are implemented effectively which can facilitate the remote operation and monitoring on the user information, vehicle information, order information inorder to intelligent decision-making and control.

Authors: Petri Helo et al.

Abstract:

Purpose
Online, on‐demand and real‐time availability of information to all members of a manufacturing system enables them to be agile and in the best position to react quickly, efficiently, synchronously, and collectively to the changing market. This paper proposes an integrated web‐based logistics management system for agile supply demand network design (ASDN).

Design/methodology/approach
The paper presents a software system, which is distributed as open source. A case study of ABB Company in Finland has been undertaken and this demonstrates the validity of ASDN in designing and managing supply demand networks.

Findings
Current software applications, such as ERP, WMS and EAI do not support a higher‐level decision making. There are several performance measures, which are directly connected to structure of the network.

Practical implications
The presented software supports modeling, analyzing and limited optimizing of supply demand networks. Also discussed is the network level logistics analysis that is behind the modeling tool.

Originality/value
The paper introduces the ASDN software, which is freely available for research and commercial uses. The case example shows how this type of network architecture‐related decisions can be analyzed.

6. **Title: Chatbots in Logistics: A Field Experiment on Intelligent Freight Dispatching**

DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4296708 

Authors: Wanfeng Yan et al.

Abstract:

Fueled by the widespread adoption of algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of chatbots has become increasingly popular in various business contexts. In this paper, they study how to effectively and appropriately use chatbots in logistics, particularly in dispatching freights automatically. Specifically, this paper seeks to understand the effects of two voice chatbot design features (i.e., identity disclosure and anthropomorphism) on the operational performance of freight dispatching. In collaboration with a large truck-sharing platform, they conducted a field experiment that randomly assigned over 10,000 truck drivers to receive outbound calls from the voice chatbot dispatcher of our focal platform. Our empirical results suggest that chatbot identity disclosure at the beginning of the conversation significantly reduces the operational performance in terms of response rate. However, humanizing the voice chatbot by adding our proposed anthropomorphism features (i.e., interjections and filler words) significantly improves response rate, conversation duration, and order acceptance intention. Moreover, interestingly, humanizing the voice chatbot along with its identity disclosure can still improve operational outcomes, and its magnitude is similar to the improvement brought about by humanizing the chatbot without identity disclosure. This finding indicates that improving anthropomorphism may potentially mitigate the negative effects of chatbot identity disclosure. Finally, they propose one plausible explanation related to the enhanced trust between humans and algorithms for the performance improvement and empirically show that drivers are more likely to disclose information to chatbot dispatchers with anthropomorphism features. Our proposed anthropomorphism improvement solutions are now being implemented and used by our collaborator platform.

7. **Title: Integration of Chatbots in the Procurement Stage of a Supply Chain**

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/CSITSS57437.2022.10026367 

Authors: Ramaa A et al.

Abstract: 

Procurement, one of the core supply chain operations, involves acquiring goods and services in the interest of carrying out business activities, which when effectively planned can lead to numerous benefits which include streamlining the process, selecting and identifying the right suppliers as well as reducing the cost amongst others. Therefore, by shifting from a transactional to strategy-oriented procurement process, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can aid in adding value to the procurement process. Chatbots powered by AI could be integrated with current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to automate the process. The focus of this study is with respect to medium-sized enterprises, the goal being to maximize advantages. In order to understand recent developments, gaps as well as the various tools and techniques currently in use, a literature review of salient work in the field of procurement was first conducted. This was followed by the formulation of the null and alternative hypotheses in order to study the relationship between the use of chatbots and the procurement stage in the supply chain. The responses were then used to generate a variety of relationships, which were then examined using Tableau and factor analysis, respectively, revealing the positive impact digitalization had on reducing supply chain costs, inventory and sales. Finally, a chatbot with features including supplier preference order, by implementing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), answers to frequently asked queries, and key procurement metrics was constructed. The responses indicated that most companies have not incorporated Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in their supply chain process and believe that the supplier relation domain has the highest chance of being most efficient.

8. **Title: AI-based chatbots in customer service and their effects on user compliance**

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12525-020-00414-7

Authors: Martin Adam et al.

Abstract:

Communicating with customers through live chat interfaces has become an increasingly popular means to provide real-time customer service in many e-commerce settings. Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot’s request for service feedback. Moreover, the results show that social presence mediates the effect of anthropomorphic design cues on user compliance.
