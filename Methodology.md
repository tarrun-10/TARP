### **Methodology**

**-** In our methodology the system will incorporate a range of cutting-edge technologies, including chatbots, natural language processing, blockchain, cloud computing, augmented 
reality, IoT, big data analytics, and serverless computing. Additionally, we have added a point regarding an IVR system to reach porters without mobile phones.

**-** Firstly, we identified the business requirements for the platform, considering the needs of the porters, customers, and the platform operator. Then, we designed the system 
architecture by selecting the appropriate technologies and tools for the platform, such as chatbot platforms, NLP tools, blockchain platforms, and cloud infrastructure providers.

**-** Next, we developed the platform's front-end and back-end components, including the user interface, chatbot, and AR capabilities, as well as databases, APIs, and other required 
services. We also implemented an IVR system to reach porters without mobile phones, which involved integrating a voice recognition technology provider and designing the IVR 
system's user flow.

**-** We also incorporated a blockchain-based payment system to ensure secure and transparent payment processing. To extract insights and patterns from the platform data, we 
implemented a big data analytics tool. Additionally, we integrated IoT devices into the platform to automate and optimize the booking process.

**-** After development and testing, we deployed the platform on the selected cloud infrastructure provider, ensuring high availability and scalability. Finally, we set up monitoring 
and alerting systems, performed regular maintenance tasks, and continuously improved the platform based on user feedback.

**-** Overall, this methodology provides a comprehensive approach to developing an advanced online porter booking system that incorporates the latest technologies and features. We 
added a point regarding the IVR system to make the platform more accessible to porters without mobile phones. As a team, we believe that this methodology will result in a 
platform that is highly secure, scalable, and user-friendly.
