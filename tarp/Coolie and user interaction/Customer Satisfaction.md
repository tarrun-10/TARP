Tarrun:

Hi Parth, I think it's important to ensure that coolies and users have a positive and seamless interaction through our platform. This will help to ensure customer satisfaction and create a positive experience for both coolies and users.

Parth:

I agree, Tarun. One way to do this is to have a user-friendly interface that allows for easy booking and communication between coolies and users. This could include features such as real-time tracking of coolies, in-app messaging, and real-time updates on the status of bookings.
