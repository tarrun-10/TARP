Tarrun:

Finally, I think it's important to have a system in place for managing disputes and resolving any issues that may arise between coolies and customers. This could include a dispute resolution process and an in-app messaging system to facilitate communication.

Parth:

I couldn't agree more, Tarun. By taking these steps, we can encourage coolies to switch from traditional systems to our coolie booking app start-up, and provide them with a more efficient and effective way to work. This will help to create a positive and sustainable business model for our coolie booking app start-up.
