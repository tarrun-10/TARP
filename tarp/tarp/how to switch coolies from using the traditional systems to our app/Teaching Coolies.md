Tarrun:

Hi Parth, I think it's important to consider how we can switch coolies from using traditional systems to our coolie booking app start-up. This is crucial for the success of our business and to provide coolies with a more efficient and effective way to work.

Parth:

I agree, Tarun. One way to do this is to provide coolies with incentives for using our platform. This could include bonuses for completing a certain number of bookings, higher earnings, and access to more job opportunities.
