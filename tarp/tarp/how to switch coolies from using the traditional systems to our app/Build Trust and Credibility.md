Another way to encourage coolies to switch to our platform is to build trust and credibility with coolies by consistently providing fair and transparent earnings and incentives. This will help coolies to see the benefits of using our platform and encourage them to make the switch.

Parth:

I completely agree. And it's also important to actively engage with coolies and gather their feedback on the platform and their experiences. This will help us to identify areas for improvement and make any necessary changes to ensure that coolies are happy and satisfied with our platform.
