Tarrun:

Hi Parth, I think it's important to consider the issue of weight limitations for coolies in our coolie booking app start-up. We need to ensure that coolies are able to safely perform their job and that customers are able to receive the services they need.

Parth:

I agree, Tarun. One way to handle this issue is to have a system in place for verifying the age and weight of coolies before they are able to work on the platform. This could include a simple self-declaration system or a more robust verification process, such as a medical examination.
