Tarrun:

Finally, I think it's important to have a rewards and incentives system in place to encourage positive behavior and create a positive working environment for coolies. This could include incentives such as bonuses for good customer reviews, rewards for safe driving, and recognition for positive performance.

Parth:

That's a great point, Tarun. By taking these steps, we can ensure that coolies and users have a positive and seamless interaction through our platform, and that both are able to receive the services they need in a timely and effective manner. This will help to create a positive and sustainable business model for our coolie booking app start-up.
