Tarrun:

Hi Parth, I think that it's critical that we ensure that coolies are not exploited in any way through our platform. We need to make sure that they are paid fairly and that they have a safe and positive working environment.

Parth:

I completely agree, Tarun. We need to have strong policies in place that ensure that coolies are treated fairly and are not subjected to any form of exploitation. This could include measures such as setting fair payment rates, providing a safe and secure work environment, and ensuring that coolies have access to training and support.
