Tarrun:

Finally, I think it's important to actively engage with coolies and gather their feedback on the platform and their experiences. This will help us to identify areas for improvement and make any necessary changes to ensure that coolies are not exploited in any way.

Parth:

I couldn't agree more, Tarun. By taking these steps, we can ensure that coolies are treated fairly and are not subjected to any form of exploitation. This will help to create a positive and sustainable business model for our coolie booking app start-up.
