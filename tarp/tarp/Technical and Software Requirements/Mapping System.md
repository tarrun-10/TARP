Tarrun:

Hi Parth, I think that the most important software requirement for a coolie booking app startup is a robust mapping system. This system should be able to find the nearest available coolies and provide an accurate estimate of their arrival time. This will ensure that users have a positive experience and are able to get the services they need in a timely manner.

Parth:

I agree with you Tarun, but I think that real-time communication is also a critical requirement. Users should be able to communicate with coolies in real-time, for example through in-app messaging or push notifications. This will help to ensure that users have all the information they need and can receive updates on the status of their booking in real-time.
