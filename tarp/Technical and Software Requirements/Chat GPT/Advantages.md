Tarrun:

Hi Parth, I think it would be beneficial to consider integrating a chatbot, such as ChatGPT, into our coolie booking app start-up. This will allow us to provide quick and efficient customer support, automate repetitive tasks, and improve the overall user experience.

Parth:

I agree, Tarun. Chatbots powered by natural language processing and machine learning can provide instant customer support and answer frequently asked questions, reducing the need for manual support. This can help us to save time and resources, and improve the customer experience.
