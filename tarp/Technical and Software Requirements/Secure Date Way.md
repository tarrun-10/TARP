Another important requirement is a secure payment gateway integration that supports multiple payment options. Users should be able to easily make payments using their preferred payment method, and the platform should have a secure payment gateway integration to protect user data.

That's a great point, I completely agree. Security is a top priority for any platform, especially one that involves financial transactions. The platform should also have secure authentication and authorization systems to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
