Another critical requirement is scalability. The platform should be able to handle a growing user base and increasing demand for coolie services, and be easily scalable as needed. This will ensure that the platform remains stable and can accommodate future growth.

I couldn't agree more. The platform should also have an admin dashboard that allows for easy management of the platform, including the ability to manage coolies, manage bookings, and generate reports. This will help to ensure that the platform is well-managed and that important metrics and data are easily accessible
