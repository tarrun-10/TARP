Another way to handle this issue is to provide support and training to coolies on safe lifting techniques and ergonomics. This could help to reduce the risk of injury and ensure that coolies are able to perform their job safely and effectively.

Parth:

I agree, Tarun. It's also important to have a system in place for handling complaints and resolving any issues that may arise, such as disputes over weight limitations. This could include an in-app messaging system or a dedicated customer support team.
